## üìù How to Use These Skills

### Automatic Usage (Recommended)

Claude Code automatically detects when to use these skills based on your requests. Just ask naturally:

**Playwright Examples:**
```
"Test if the marketing page looks good on mobile and desktop"
"Check if the login form redirects correctly"
"Take a screenshot of the homepage"
"Test all the links on this page"
```

**iOS Simulator Examples:**
```
"Navigate to the login screen in my iOS simulator"
"Fill in the username field with test@example.com"
"What buttons are available on this screen?"
"Check this screen for accessibility issues"
"Run the iOS build and show me any errors"
```

### Manual Script Usage (Optional)

You can also run scripts directly from the command line.

**Playwright Manual Usage:**
```bash
# Detect running dev servers
cd ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill && node -e "require('./lib/helpers').detectDevServers().then(s => console.log(JSON.stringify(s)))"

# Run a custom test script
cd ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill && node run.js /tmp/my-test.js
```

**iOS Simulator Manual Usage:**
```bash
# Map current screen
python ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator-skill/skill/scripts/screen_mapper.py

# Launch an app
python ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator-skill/skill/scripts/app_launcher.py --launch com.example.app

# Find and tap a button
python ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator-skill/skill/scripts/navigator.py --find-text "Login" --tap

# Check accessibility
python ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator-skill/skill/scripts/accessibility_audit.py
```

## üéØ Quick Start Examples

### Playwright: Test a Login Flow
```bash
# Let Claude do it automatically:
"Test the login flow with username test@example.com and password demo123"

# Or manually:
cd ~/.claude/skills/playwright-skill
# Claude will auto-detect server and write custom test script to /tmp
# Then execute: node run.js /tmp/playwright-test-login.js
```

### iOS Simulator: Complete Login Test
```bash
# Let Claude do it automatically:
"Launch the app, navigate to login, and test the login flow"

# Or manually:
cd ~/.claude/skills/ios-simulator-skill
python skill/scripts/app_launcher.py --launch com.example.app
python skill/scripts/screen_mapper.py
python skill/scripts/navigator.py --find-type TextField --index 0 --enter-text "user@test.com"
python skill/scripts/navigator.py --find-type SecureTextField --enter-text "password123"
